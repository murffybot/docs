# What is Blaster?

First, developing **Blaster** started in 2019. Under name _**GarfieldBot.**_ It was one of first polish Discord bots.

Couple months later, _**GarfieldBot**_  team, decided to discontinue project. Main owner - **mafineeek**, in 2020 decided to reactivate old project. In July 2020, _**GarfieldBot**_ arrived, with total rebrand, and many new functions. Multilanguage, **dashboard**, autoresponders, auto mode etc. etc. Named - "**MurFFy**". It had crazy guild growth. **MurFFy**, in day of release reached 300 guilds. It was one of the best bots \(free, and functional\). In 2021, **mafineeek**'s account got hacked, since that time theres nothing left from **MurFFy**...



**Welcome Blaster, new multilingual, multifunctional, fun and economy bot!**
